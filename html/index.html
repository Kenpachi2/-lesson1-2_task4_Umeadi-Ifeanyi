            Yoga is an ancient practice that originated in India over 5,000
            years ago. It involves a combination of physical postures, breathing
            exercises, meditation, and relaxation techniques. While yoga is
            primarily known for its physical benefits, such as increased
            flexibility and strength, it is also a powerful form of meditation.
            Yoga as a form of medication involves using the practice of yoga to
            improve physical and mental health. The physical postures, or
            asanas, help to improve flexibility, strength, balance, and
            circulation, while the breathing exercises, or pranayama, help to
            calm the mind and improve respiratory function. The mental benefits
            of yoga are well documented. Regular practice can help to reduce
            stress, anxiety, and depression, and increase feelings of relaxation
            and calm. This is because yoga works to balance the nervous system,
            calming the sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for the
            fight or flight response, and activating the parasympathetic nervous
            system, which is responsible for rest and relaxation. Yoga is an
            ancient practice that combines physical, mental, and spiritual
            elements to help individuals achieve a state of inner peace and
            balance. This website explores the use of yoga as a form of
            meditation and provides additional resources for those interested in
            learning more.

            <h2>How to perform Yoga</h2>
            <p>Below are some steps on how to carry out yoga meditation</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Choose a suitable space: Find a quiet and comfortable space
                    where you can practice yoga. The space should be clean,
                    well-ventilated, and preferably without distractions.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Choose comfortable clothing: Wear comfortable and breathable
                    clothing that allows you to move freely. Avoid wearing tight
                    or restrictive clothing.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Choose a yoga mat: A yoga mat provides cushioning and helps
                    prevent slipping. If you don't have a yoga mat, you can use
                    a non-slippery surface.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Warm up: It's important to warm up before you start any yoga
                    practice. You can do some gentle stretching exercises or
                    perform a few rounds of Surya Namaskar (Sun Salutation).
                </li>

                <li>
                    Choose a yoga style: There are many different styles of
                    yoga, such as Hatha, Vinyasa, Bikram, Ashtanga, and more.
                    Choose a style that suits your fitness level and goals.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Follow a sequence: It's important to follow a sequence of
                    yoga poses or asanas. You can start with basic poses and
                    gradually progress to more challenging ones.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Breathe deeply: Yoga involves deep breathing, which helps
                    calm the mind and relax the body. Remember to breathe deeply
                    and slowly through the nose.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Stay focused: Yoga is a meditative practice that requires
                    focus and concentration. Try to stay present and focused on
                    your breath and movement.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Cool down: After your yoga practice, it's important to cool
                    down and relax your body. You can do some gentle stretching
                    exercises or practice yoga nidra (yogic sleep).
                </li>

                <li>
                    Practice regularly: Consistency is key when it comes to
                    yoga. Try to practice yoga regularly, even if it's just for
                    a few minutes a day.
